tradespring

=======================================

this is an experimental classifieds site I build using ruby on rails. You can visit it at https://tradespring.herokuapp.com
It may take a little while to load but it should work. It was originally build with an sqlite3 database but I switched it to postgresql in order to be able to put it on heroku. 

The idea behind the website is to create a hassle-free, more efficient version of craigslist. On craiglists, you have to worry about your listings getting deleted every 7 days, and less visible as time goes on from the moment they are created. Additionally if you want to buy something, you have to pick between browsing the for sale section or posting in the wanted section. Likewsise if you want to sell something. 

With tradespring on the other hand, you can browse for sale and want to buy at the same time with the side-by-side layout on the home page and on your own account page. Additionally, there is a bidding aspect which creates additional value for the seller and buyer. People make offers publicly in the comments section. This doesn't have to be monetary offers but can be items they are willing to trade. Additionally they can ask questions which can increase the quality of the post for everyone interested. Finally, every post stays on your account page and is searchable for as long as you want it to be there. You can put it up and forget about it until someone emails you many months down the road. Of course you can delete it when you have sold the item or found what you want to buy, etc. 

In summary, tradespring is designed to fix everything I find wrong with classifieds/auction sides. It is the site that I would want to use. Of course, there is pretty much no traffic right now so that kind of ruins the point of a classifieds site, but thats a different story.
